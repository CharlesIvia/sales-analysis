# sales-analysis
After cleaning the data, the next section was data exploration. 
In this section, I explore 5 high level business questions related to the sales data:

* What is the best month  for sales
* How much were the sales earning in each month?
* What city had the most sales?
* What is the optimal advertisement time to maximize likelihood of customers buying product?
* What products are most often sold together?
